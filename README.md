# Juju's Adobe Scripts Collection

This is a bunch of useful scripts I wrote as I needed them and I hope they're useful to someone else.

## SetMarkersToMusic.jsx

Compatible with Adobe After Effects

This script puts markers on every beat on your music according to a set tempo setting, especially useful if you're going to sync your video with music.

### How to use

1. Edit the first 3 lines with your desired settings
2. Select the music layer (or any other layer, it doesn't really care)
3. Run the script in After Effects
4. ????
5. Markers everywhere

### To do (aka list of desired features
- Run it according to selection?
- A GUI/toolbar thing so you don't have to edit the file everytime
